# pimax_bs_manager - Pimax HTC Base Station manager for Windows


## Obsolete, new BSManager at: https://github.com/mann1x/BSManager


Original code from:
https://github.com/TheMalkavien/lhbsv1_pimax

Thanks a lot to TheMalkavien for posting is work and all the previous contributors!

Usage:
- Just run the executable or the Python script (tested on 3.7.4) 
- Status console via system tray menu, log output and status display with autoscroll
- Status is available on the hover text on the system tray icon (just move the mouse over it and you'll get HS and BS status)
- Basestation mode "Auto" defaults to Ping, "Idle" execute last command and idles
- The status panel windows includes th following buttons:
  - Copy to clipboard: will copy the logs in the window to your clipboard
  - Headset Debug: the Headset connection will be forced on
  - BS Switch mode: change behavior from Auto to Idle and vice versa
  - BS Standby: send a Standby/Off sequence to the Basestations
  - BS Wakeup: send a Wakeup/Ping sequence to the Basestations
  - Run BS discovery: run again the Basestations Discovery
  - Close: hide the window, pause the dashboard updates
- If you have Windows installed not in C: please check the location of the LightHouse DB json file in the .ini file

New from the original script:
- Discovery of base stations
- Status console with status display, log output, copy log o clipboard
- System tray icon with status of Headset and Base stations via mouse hover text
- Re-discovery of base stations
- Issue of Standby command once the Headset is Off

Command line switches:
- "--debug_ignore_usb", "Disable the USB search for headset"
- "--debug_logs", "Enable DEBUG level logs"
- "--version", show version  number in a toast notification

Limitations:
- Tested only on my HTC BS with latest firmware and on Windows 10

Requirements:
- HTC Base stations 1.0
- Python dependencies: on top of the original dependencies there's infi.systray for the Windows System Tray
- Bluetooth in Windows with BLE protocol (it does NOT use the Pimax or Vive Bluetooth controller)
- The Base stations must be paired in Windows (on Windows 10 you should get an Add Device popup for each BS)

Single executable available with ini and ico file in a ZIP file:
- Built with: pyinstaller --onefile Pimax_BSAW.py --hidden-import pkg_resources --hidden-import infi.systray --hidden-import bleak --add-binary "BleakUWPBridge.dll;BleakUWPBridge" --icon=pimax.ico --version-file pimax_bsaw_version_info.txt --noconsole
- You need to copy BleakUWPBridge.dll in the script directory from %HOMEPATH%\Miniconda3\Lib\site-packages\bleak\backends\dotnet\ (in this case using Miniconda)

Support:
- None, but you can post in this Pimax forum thread for help: https://forum.pimaxvr.com/t/how-to-power-off-basestations-remotely/15205/109

Todo:
- Support for Valve BS v2, preliminary code in, still not working
